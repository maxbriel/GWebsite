University of Amsterdam: Graviational Waves

Code to create ASD, Waveform, and sound files from the known graviational wave events (mid-2018). 
Furthermore, sky maps from the events are processed in the same script. 
All this is shown on a custom website allowing for easy showing of the information. 

For the preview the Hanford 1 data has been used. 

The data can be found at [LIGO Open Science Centre](https://losc.ligo.org/events/).
